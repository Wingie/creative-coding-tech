My work bridges the technical and the contemplative. Eight years leading engineering teams taught me how systems work. Fifteen years of contemplative practice taught me how consciousness works. The intersection is where I live.

## Offerings

### Wilderness & Threshold

**[Vision Quest Facilitation](/offerings/vision-quest-facilitation/)**

Four days and nights alone in European wilderness. The oldest technology for transformation we have. Guided preparation, safe threshold crossing, and grounded integration.

### Dream & Inner Life

**[Lucid Dream Training](/offerings/lucid-dream-training/)**

Learn to wake up inside your dreams. A structured approach combining Western techniques with contemplative practice. Self-paced courses, live cohorts, and private training.

**[Spirit Guide Connection](/offerings/spirit-guide-connection/)**

Perceive and communicate with non-physical guidance. A grounded methodology that works regardless of your metaphysical framework.

### Shadow & Integration

**[Shadow Work Integration](/offerings/shadow-work-integration/)**

Reclaim what you've rejected, hidden, or never had permission to be. Individual sessions, series work, and intensive group formats in Amsterdam.

### Meditation & Contemplation

**[Insight Meditation](/offerings/insight-meditation/)**

Traditional vipassana practice for seeing clearly. Weekly sits in Amsterdam, individual instruction, and retreat support.

### Technology & Ritual

**[Creative Coding as Contemplative Practice](/offerings/creative-coding-ritual/)**

Code as meditation. Algorithms as ritual. Build personal tools for transformation using TouchDesigner, Sonic Pi, and custom systems.

## How I Work

I meet you where you are. Some people come with a clear question. Some come with a vague sense that something needs to change. Both are valid starting points.

The [Oracle](/oracle/) is the best way to begin—a brief conversation that helps us both understand what might serve you.

## Background

I spent eight years as an engineering leader at companies building real-time systems. The skills I developed there—debugging complex problems, building reliable architecture, navigating uncertainty—turned out to be directly applicable to inner work.

My contemplative training includes 15+ years of insight meditation, extended work with shadow integration and active imagination, training in wilderness rites of passage, and ongoing study of esoteric traditions.

I hold sessions in Amsterdam and online. Vision quests happen at various locations across Europe.

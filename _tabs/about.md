## What I Do

I build systems that serve millions of people — and then I go home and live-code music at midnight.

Currently I lead the Flights engineering team at **Booking.com**, one of the world's largest travel platforms. Before that I was CTO of a startup in India, a software engineer in Dubai, and a computer science student in Vellore who couldn't stop writing code even when the assignment was done.

The through-line: I've always been more interested in what technology *can become* than what it already is.

## The Journey

**VIT University, Vellore, India** — Where it started. CS degree, midnight hackathons, first taste of building things that actually ran.

**Dubai** — First industry years. Learned that production systems are humbling. Learned that good engineering is mostly good thinking, not good typing.

**Workshop India (CTO)** — Led the technical vision for an education startup. Built teams, made architectural calls, shipped products used by thousands. The crucible.

**Amsterdam → Booking.com** — Joined as a senior engineer, grew into Engineering Manager for Flights. Now responsible for a platform that handles hundreds of millions of searches annually, leading a team of 12+ engineers across multiple time zones.

## Engineering Philosophy

**Fifteen years** of building production systems has given me strong opinions:

- Distributed systems fail in creative ways — design for it
- The best architecture is the one your team can actually maintain
- AI/ML is most powerful when it's invisible to the user
- You don't understand a system until you've debugged it at 2am

I've built ML pipelines before "LLM" was a household word, designed RAG systems before the acronym existed, and migrated monoliths to microservices more times than I can count.

## Creative Technology

This is the part that surprises people.

I started live-coding music with **Sonic Pi** as a side project. That led to **SuperCollider**, then **MaxMSP**, then building audio-reactive visuals in **TouchDesigner** and **Unreal Engine 5**.

The project I'm most proud of in this space: **Ableton MCP** — I built one of the first MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations for Ableton Live, letting AI assistants directly control music production software. That repo now has hundreds of stars and spawned a whole ecosystem of MCP music tools.

The creative coding thread isn't separate from the engineering work. It's where I experiment without constraints, develop taste for system design, and stay curious about what computation *feels like*.

## Open Source

100+ public repositories across tools, experiments, and systems:

- **[FlowState](https://github.com/wingie/FlowState)** — Distributed task orchestration with ML-powered scheduling
- **[LLM-Pokemon-Red](https://github.com/wingie/llm-pokemon-red)** — LLM agent playing Pokémon Red autonomously
- **[Ableton-MCP](https://github.com/wingie/ableton-mcp)** — Ableton Live ↔ AI assistant via Model Context Protocol
- **[BriefGPT](https://github.com/wingie/BriefGPT)** — Document intelligence and summarization system
- **[Claude Code Router](https://github.com/wingie/claude-code-router)** — Multi-model routing for Claude Code

## Beyond Work

**Chairman, Taste Before You Waste** — Amsterdam-based nonprofit reducing food waste through community redistribution.

**Live Coding** — I perform at local events on the algorave circuit. Code that makes sound, in real time, in public.

**70+ countries visited** — The world is a remarkable system. I try to study it directly.

## Working Together

I take on selective consulting engagements for AI/ML strategy, engineering leadership, system architecture, and creative technology prototyping.

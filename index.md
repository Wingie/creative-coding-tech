### The Intersection of Music and Code

Hello and welcome! My name is Wingston Sharon Wilson. By day, I'm an Engineering Manager with 15 years of experience in Java, Python, Scala, where I've spent years leading teams, solving problems through software and data science, and transforming how millions of people experience travel. My career has been a deep dive into scalable system design, enterprise software, and a wide array of machine learning applicationsâ€”from building ROI-based ML eligibility campaigns to vector-based search engines.

While I love the challenges of building large-scale platforms, I have an equally strong passion for the intersection where technology meets creative expression. In my free time, I explore real-time audio performance with Ableton Live and build audio-reactive projects with Unreal Engine. This blog is where these two worlds collide.

### The First Series: Machine Learning, Music, and Live Coding

For our inaugural series, we're jumping headfirst into the exciting world of live-coded music, focusing on two powerful tools: **Sonic Pi** and **Ableton Live**.

But we're going beyond the basics of just coding a beat. We will explore how we can infuse our musical creations with intelligence using machine learning. My professional experience has involved training ML models, creating feedback loops with reinforcement learning, and delivering personalized user experiences. I'm fascinated by the idea of applying these same concepts to the audio space.

In this series, we will tackle projects such as:

* **Generative Melodies with Reinforcement Learning:** At Booking.com, I helped build a closed-loop feedback system using reinforcement learning to deliver hotel recommendations. What if we could use a similar approach to create a musical "agent"? We could train a model that learns from a simple input melody and generates complex, evolving harmonic sequences that respond to the performer in real-time.

* **Real-time Audio Feature Analysis:** We will explore how to analyze incoming audio in Sonic Pi, extract features like pitch, rhythm, and timbre, and use that data to trigger dynamic, responsive events and effects within Ableton Live. This pulls from the same principles used in building real-time data systems for fraud detection, similar to the real-time credit card check system I implemented.

* **Algorithmic Composition:** We will design systems that can compose entire sections of music based on a set of rules and probabilistic models. This is about creating a collaborative partner in the creative process, one that can surprise you and push your musical ideas in new directions.

My goal is to demystify these advanced topics and show you that the same logic used to solve complex engineering problems can be a powerful tool for artistic expression. Whether you're a developer curious about creative applications for your skills, or a musician wanting to explore the world of code, there will be something here for you.

Let's start this journey together. Follow along on the blog and check out the code repositories on my GitHub at [github.com/wingie](https://github.com/wingie). Let's make some noise!

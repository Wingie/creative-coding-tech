Algorithmic composition used to be for math nerds who liked the *idea* of music more than music itself.
Now we have AI.
And the AI actually knows what a "Groove" is.
We can feed **context** into the machine.
We can say "Make it funky."
And Strudel (JavaScript in the browser, God help us) will output code that makes your head nod.

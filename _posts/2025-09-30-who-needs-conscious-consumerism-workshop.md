You have 5 mechanical keyboards.
You have a closet full of "Sustainable" clothes that you never wear.
You have a shelf of unread books that signal your intelligence to guests who never visit.

**You are an addict.**

We are all addicts. The drug is Dopamine, and the dealer is Amazon Prime.

## The Lie of "Ethical Consumption"

There is no such thing as "Ethical Consumption" if you are consuming to regulate your emotions.
Buying a bamboo toothbrush feels good. It saves a turtle (so they say).
But if you buy it because you are anxious about your job... you are still using a purchase to fix a feeling.

## This Workshop is about The Shadow

We use **Shadow Work**.
We ask the rude questions:
- Why do you need that $300 knife?
- Who are you trying to impress?
- Is it your father? (It's always the father).

This isn't about minimalism. Minimalism is just "Reverse Materialism" - obsessing about *not* having things is still obsessing about things.
This is about **Freedom**.

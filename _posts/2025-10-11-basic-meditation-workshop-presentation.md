# Basic Meditation: Foundation Practices for Mindful Living

Discover how **meditation for beginners** can transform your relationship with stress, anxiety, and present-moment awareness.

## Why Learn These Three Meditation Techniques Together?

**Samadhi gives you stability** — Without concentration, the mind is too scattered to observe clearly. You're building the foundation.

**Vipassana gives you wisdom** — Without insight, concentration becomes mere absorption. You're seeing reality as it is.

**Metta gives you warmth** — Without lovingkindness, practice becomes harsh and joyless. You're opening the heart.

Together, they create a **balanced meditation path: stable, wise, and compassionate**.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need meditation experience to join?**
No! This workshop is specifically designed for complete beginners. We start from the very beginning with posture, breath, and working with the wandering mind.

**What if I "can't meditate" or "can't sit still"?**
Perfect—you're in the right place. The myth of "can't meditate" usually comes from trying to force the mind to be still, which doesn't work. We'll teach you how to actually work with your mind.

**How much time will I need to practice at home?**
We recommend starting with 10 minutes daily. The guided recordings provided make home practice easy and accessible.

**Is this religious or spiritual?**
The techniques taught have roots in Buddhist meditation but are presented in a secular, accessible way. People of all faiths (or no faith) find these practices valuable.

**What if I've tried before and couldn't stick with it?**
That's exactly why we focus on building a *sustainable* practice. Week 6 is entirely devoted to designing a practice structure that fits your life, not someone else's ideal.

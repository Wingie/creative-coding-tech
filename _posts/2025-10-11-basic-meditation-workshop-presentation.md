Meditation has a branding problem.

You see stock photos of people in white linen sitting on beaches, looking serene. They are smiling. They look like they have never experienced a merge conflict in their lives.

This is a lie.

Real meditation—the kind that actually changes your brain—is not about relaxation. It is not about "clearing your mind."

**Real meditation is about debugging.**

Your brain is running a legacy codebase written by evolution over millions of years. It is optimized for one thing: **Not Getting Eaten By Tigers.**

It is *not* optimized for:
- Writing code.
- Navigating complex social hierarchies.
- Sitting in an open-plan office.
- Being happy.

So you have this background process (the Default Mode Network) that is constantly scanning for threats. "Did I sound stupid in that meeting?" "Is the server down?" "Why did she use that emoji?"

It is a Denial of Service attack on your own happiness.

## The Workshop: System Administration for Your Psyche

In this 6-week workshop, we don't light incense. We don't chant. We get under the hood.

We teach three core tools:

### 1. Samadhi (Focus)
This is `kill -9` for wandering thoughts. It is the ability to place your attention on one thing (the breath) and keep it there. It sounds easy. It is the hardest thing you will ever do.

### 2. Vipassana (Insight)
This is the debugger. We watch the code run. We see the inputs (sensations, thoughts) and the outputs (emotions, reactions). We start to see the bugs. "Oh, every time I feel tired, I get angry." That's a bug. Note it.

### 3. Metta (Lovingkindness)
This is the patch. It's rewriting the "Self-Criticism" subroutine. Instead of beating yourself up, you learn to... well, not be a jerk to yourself. It feels cheesy at first. Then it feels life-changing.

## Why This Matters for Technologists

You rely on your brain for your livelihood. You wouldn't run a server for 10 years without a reboot, a security patch, or a log review.

But that's what you're doing with your mind.

You are running high-performance cognitive tasks on a system that is fragmented, distracted, and running hot.

It's time for some maintenance.

## The Promise

I won't promise you enlightenment. I won't promise you'll never be stressed again.

I promise you will **knowing what your mind is doing** instead of being a victim of it.

You will have `root` access to your own attention.

I once worked on a project at Big Tech Co. (rhymes with "Goo-book") where we spun up 5,000 servers to process logs that nobody ever looked at.

We burned enough electricity to power a small city, just to generate a dashboard that one middle manager checked once a quarter.

It made me sick.

We talk about "The Cloud" like it's this ethereal, magical place. It's not. It's a windowless warehouse in Virginia sucking down coal power and evaporating millions of gallons of water for cooling.

**Every line of code you write has a cost.** Not just $0.0004 per Lambda invocation. A *physical* cost.

## The Workshop: Coding as if the Planet Mattered

This workshop is about **Conscious Coding**. We use the **micro:bit** because it forces you to think small. It forces you to think about constraints.

We build a Smart Greenhouse.

"Oh, cute," you say. "A toy."

No. It's a lesson in resource management.

### The Curriculum

1.  **Sensors = Truth**: We learn to read moisture sensors. Not "simulated" moisture. Real dirt. Real water. You learn that reality is messy and analog, unlike your pristine JSON APIs.
2.  **The Energy Budget**: We run these things on batteries. You learn to write efficient code because if you don't, your plant dies. That's effective motivation.
3.  **The "Why"**: We use Integral Theory to ask: *Why* are we building this? Is it to automate nature (bad)? Or to connect with it (good)?

## Shadow Work for Devs

We also do something that will make standard engineers uncomfortable: **Moral debugging.**

We ask:
- Does this feature need to exist?
- Who benefits from this data collection?
- What is the worst-case scenario?

## Join the Rebellion

I'm tired of building "Smart Toasters" that mine crypto.
I'm tired of "Smart Fridges" that display ads.

Let's build technology that actually serves life, instead of extracting from it.

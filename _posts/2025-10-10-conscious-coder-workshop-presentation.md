## What You'll Build: The Smart Greenhouse Project

### 🌱 **Real Hardware, Real Impact**

Using the **micro:bit Smart Agriculture Kit**, you'll build a complete environmental monitoring and plant care system:

- **Temperature & Humidity Sensors** — Track environmental conditions
- **Soil Moisture Detection** — Know exactly when plants need water
- **Automated Water Pump** — But designed for connection, not replacement
- **LED Notifications** — Visual feedback and "plant messenger" system
- **Data Logging** — Make invisible resource consumption visible
- **Custom Programming** — Every line written intentionally in MakeCode (blocks or Python)

This isn't a toy project. It's a fully functional system you'll understand from the ground up—and can expand indefinitely.

---

## What You'll Discover in This Conscious Coding Workshop

### Week 1: 🔬 Unveiling the Data Reality
**The Ongoing Data Stream**
- Kit assembly and setup
- Introduction to MakeCode environment (blocks or Python)
- Reading sensors: temperature, humidity, soil moisture
- Building an environmental dashboard
- **Philosophy:** Every sensor reading is reality "bursting into being fresh"—the technical parallel to the "Ongoing Big Bang"

### Week 2: 🧩 Holistic View of Technical Systems
**AQAL Model for Code**
- Serial communication and data logging
- Analyzing your project through four quadrants:
  - **UR (It)**: Objective hardware, measurable data, lines of code
  - **UL (I)**: Your personal experience coding, feelings interpreting data
  - **LR (Its)**: External systems (power grid, heating system context)
  - **LL (We)**: Cultural values embedded in code, shared meanings
- **Avoiding reductionism** by seeing the whole system

### Week 3: 🌿 Evolving the Code
**Spiral Dynamics in System Design**
- Control logic with if-then-else statements
- Controlling the water pump based on sensor input
- **Three approaches to watering:**
  - **Orange Logic:** "If moisture < X, pump ON"—rigid, results-driven
  - **Green Logic:** "Use minimal water, be gentle"—values-oriented
  - **Yellow Logic:** "Consider moisture + time + humidity"—systemic, adaptive
- **Transcend and include:** Integrating all previous wisdom

### Week 4: 👻 Unmasking the Shadow in Tech
**Critical Self-Reflection in Code**
- Code review for assumptions and biases
- Fail-safes and error handling
- **Shadow questions:**
  - What unintended consequences exist?
  - Does my code project an identity of perfect control?
  - What happens when faced with societal pressure for "always-on" tech?
- Programming fail-safes to bring shadow into light

### Week 5: 💧 Quantifying Consumption & Impact
**Making Invisible Costs Visible**
- Variables and counters to track resources
- Calibrating pump flow rate (ml per second)
- Building a resource use dashboard
- **Philosophy:** If we can't see consumption, it remains unconscious—visibility creates consciousness

### Week 6: ❤️ Coding as Caretaking
**From Automation to Connection**
- UI/UX design for helpful notifications (not annoying alerts)
- **Transformation:** From system watering automatically to system notifying human
- Building the "Plant Messenger"—reclaiming instinct to care for living things
- **Emotional alchemy in code:** Systems that help us feel our feelings and connect to life

### Week 7: 🪞 Technology as Mirror & The Integrated Coder
**Shamanic Mirroring with Data + Camel-Lion-Child**
- Symbolic interpretation: connecting objective data to subjective experience
- Journaling with data mirror: "Room was cold and dry—was I emotionally cold or dry?"
- **The Metamorphosis of the Coder:**
  - **Camel:** Following tutorial exactly, burden of "correct way"
  - **Lion:** Rejecting conventions, saying NO, but stuck
  - **Child:** Integrating knowledge + freedom for joyful creation
- Creative coding: Make the plant "sing" by turning moisture data into music!

### Week 8: 🚀 Open-Source Consciousness & Collective Impact
**Code as Planetary Service**
- Code documentation with clear comments and readme files
- Understanding open-source ethos
- Publishing to GitHub as act of planetary service
- Final project showcase
- **The 10% tipping point:** Contributing to critical mass of conscious coders

## Real Code Examples from the Workshop

### Environmental Dashboard (Week 1)

```python
# Environmental Dashboard
from microbit import *

while True:
    # Read sensors
    temp = temperature()
    humidity = pin0.read_analog()
    moisture = pin1.read_analog()

    # Display temperature
    display.scroll(f"T:{temp}C")
    sleep(1000)

    # Display humidity
    humidity_pct = int((humidity / 1023) * 100)
    display.scroll(f"H:{humidity_pct}%")
    sleep(1000)

    # Display soil moisture
    moisture_pct = int((moisture / 1023) * 100)
    display.scroll(f"M:{moisture_pct}%")
    sleep(1000)

    # Show happy/sad face
    if temp > 18 and moisture_pct > 40:
        display.show(Image.HAPPY)
    else:
        display.show(Image.SAD)

    sleep(2000)
```

### Three Approaches to Watering (Week 3)

```python
# Orange Logic - Rigid, results-driven
if moisture < 30:
    pump.on()
    sleep(5000)
    pump.off()

# Green Logic - Values-oriented, gentle
if moisture < 30:
    pump.on()
    sleep(2000)  # Less water
    pump.off()

# Yellow Logic - Systemic, adaptive
if moisture < 30 and \
   is_daytime() and \
   humidity < 60:
    pump.on()
    sleep(calculate_water())
    pump.off()
```

### Plant Messenger (Week 6)

```python
# Plant Messenger - Caretaking over Automation
from microbit import *

THIRSTY_THRESHOLD = 35

while True:
    moisture_pct = int((pin1.read_analog() / 1023) * 100)

    if moisture_pct < THIRSTY_THRESHOLD:
        # Don't automate - ask human for help
        display.show(Image.SAD)
        sleep(500)
        display.show("💧")  # Water drop
        sleep(500)
    else:
        display.show(Image.HAPPY)

    # Button A = human watered the plant
    if button_a.was_pressed():
        display.show(Image.HEART)
        sleep(2000)

    sleep(5000)
```

## From Black Box to Conscious Creation

### ❌ **The Problem: Black-Box Technology**

Most of us interact with technology as consumers:
- **No idea how sensors work** — Just tap the screen
- **Can't modify or repair** — Completely dependent on manufacturers
- **Disconnected from impact** — Hidden resource consumption
- **No sense of agency** — Technology happens *to* us

### ✅ **The Solution: Conscious Creation**

This workshop teaches you to be a **conscious creator**:
- **Understand every sensor** — Temperature, humidity, moisture, how they work
- **Write every line intentionally** — No copy-paste without understanding
- **See resource consumption** — Track every drop of water used
- **Build connection** — Technology as tool for deepening relationship with environment
- **Contribute back** — Share your creation as open-source

**Result:** Empowerment, capability, and genuine connection to the technology you create.

---

## Why This Workshop Works: The Science & Philosophy

### Integral Theory Applied to Code

Traditional coding education focuses purely on syntax and logic (the **UR quadrant** in AQAL terms—objective, external, individual). This workshop is holistic:

- **Interior Individual (UL):** Your subjective experience, intentions, growth as coder
- **Exterior Individual (UR):** The actual hardware, data, functioning code
- **Interior Collective (LL):** Cultural values, shared meanings in tech community
- **Exterior Collective (LR):** Systems, infrastructure, supply chains, economic forces

When you see **all four quadrants**, you stop being a reductionist coder and become an **integral engineer**.

### Shadow Work in Debugging

Traditional debugging: "Find the error, fix it, move on."

**Conscious debugging:**
- What assumption did I make that caused this bug?
- Where is my ego showing up in this code?
- What am I unconsciously projecting onto this system?
- What fail-safes would address my fear of failure?

By bringing the **unconscious into consciousness**, your code becomes more robust and you become more self-aware.

### The 10% Tipping Point

Social science research shows that when 10% of a population adopts a new behavior with conviction, it becomes the majority norm.

**You're part of that 10% of conscious coders** whose work will shift the entire tech industry toward sustainability, consciousness, and planetary service.

---

## Embodied Practices for Coders

This isn't just sitting at a computer. Every week includes:

### 🤝 **Code Review Circles**
Partner reviews with compassionate feedback, focusing on shadow work and collective learning.

### 📝 **Reflective Journaling with Data**
Using your sensor data as mirror for inner state. "The environment was cold and dry—how was my emotional state?"

### 🐛 **Shadow Debugging Sessions**
Group sessions exploring assumptions, ego, and unconscious patterns showing up in code.

### 🎨 **Creative Coding Challenges**
The "Child's" playful experimentation: Make the plant sing! Turn moisture into music! Joyful sufficiency in code.

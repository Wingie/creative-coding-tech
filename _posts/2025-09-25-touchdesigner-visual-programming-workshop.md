Programmers hate "Visual Programming."
"It's not real code," they say. "It's just connecting boxes."

**TouchDesigner** laughs at your text editor.
TouchDesigner is high-performance C++ wrapped in a node-based interface that looks like a cyberpunk hacking minigame.

## The Node Graph

In Python, if you screw up the data flow, you get a stack trace.
In TouchDesigner, if you screw up the data flow, your texture turns into a glitch art masterpiece.
It is **Exploratory Programming**.
It encourages you to break things because breaking things looks cool.

## Who Needs This?
- **VJs**: Who want to look busy on stage.
- **Artists**: Who want to projection map a building.
- **Coders**: Who are tired of syntax errors.

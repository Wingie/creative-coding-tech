# Algorithms as Code: Where Mathematics Becomes Visual Poetry

Discover how **generative art and creative coding** can transform your artistic practice. Our "Algorithms as Code" workshop teaches you to use **p5.js for algorithmic art**—turning code into your creative canvas. Learn to generate infinite visual variations through computational techniques like noise functions, particle systems, fractals, and emergent patterns.

This isn't about writing software—it's about **reclaiming algorithms for aesthetic exploration** where code becomes a medium for visual beauty, and mathematics reveals its artistic potential.

## The Generative Art Creative Process

Our workshop teaches you to work in the iterative feedback loop used by professional generative artists:

1. **Write Code** — Express a visual idea algorithmically
2. **Run** — Execute and observe the output
3. **Observe** — What surprised you? What's beautiful?
4. **Adjust** — Tweak parameters, refine rules
5. **Repeat** — Iterate toward your aesthetic vision

This process embraces happy accidents, encourages experimentation, and reveals visual possibilities you couldn't have planned in advance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to know how to code?
**No!** This workshop is designed for complete beginners. We start with the absolute basics and build progressively.

### What if I'm "not good at math"?
You don't need advanced math—we'll teach you the specific mathematical concepts as creative tools (sin, cos, noise functions). Most of it is visual, not numerical.

### Can I take individual sessions or do I need the full series?
Both options work! The full 8-session series provides the deepest learning, but individual sessions are perfect for exploring specific techniques.

### What equipment do I need?
Just a computer with a modern web browser and internet connection. Everything runs in the browser—no software to install.

### Will I own the code I create?
Absolutely! All work you create is yours. We encourage sharing in the community, but you retain full ownership.

### Can I use generative art commercially?
Yes! Many participants go on to sell prints, create client work, or integrate generative techniques into their professional practice.

### How is this different from a regular coding course?
We focus exclusively on visual creativity and artistic expression. This is art class that happens to use code, not computer science that happens to make pictures.

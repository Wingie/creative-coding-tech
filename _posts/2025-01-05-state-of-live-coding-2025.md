It used to be five people in a basement in London.
Now it's a global movement.
We have **Algoraves**. We have **Academic Conferences** (where people dance).
We have kids in primary school writing loops instead of learning the Recorder (thank God).

## The State of the Art

- **Sonic Pi**: Still the king of education.
- **TidalCycles**: Haskell for people who hate themselves but love polyrhythms.
- **Strudel**: Tidal in the browser. Zero friction. Dangerous.
- **Hydra**: Visuals. Glitch art. Seizure warnings.

The tools are mature. The community is huge.
The question is no longer "Can we do this?"
It is "What happens when everyone can do this?"

Human art is limited by physics.
Your hand gets tired. paint dries. You run out of canvas.

**Algorithms have no such weakness.**

An algorithm can paint a million trees in a second. It can explore variations you would need 10,000 lifetimes to imagine.
This workshop isn't about "Learning to Code."
It's about **firing yourself as the manual laborer** of your art and becoming the **Manager**.

## Who Needs This?
- **Painters**: Who are tired of buying paint.
- **Developers**: Who want to make something beautiful instead of another API endpoint.
- **Math Teachers**: Who want to prove that Sine Waves are actually cool.

We use **p5.js**. It runs in the browser. It breaks the rules of physics.
Stop drawing by hand. Start drawing with logic.

We used to have APIs. They were nice. They were documented.
Now we have LLMs. They are chaotic. They hallucinate.
**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is the attempt to teach the chaotic LLM how to use the nice API without breaking everything.

Imagine a robot trying to play a grand piano.
Without MCP, the robot smashes the keys with a hammer.
With MCP, the robot reads the sheet music.
It might still play jazz when you asked for classical, but at least the piano survives.

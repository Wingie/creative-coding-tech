# Reformed Mindfulness: Calvinism Meets Contemplative Practice

What if the most freeing theology in Christianity held the key to the deepest mindfulness practice? Discover how **Reformed theology** and **contemplative awareness** converge in this workshop exploring **Puritan meditation**, **sovereignty-based mindfulness**, and **Coram Deo living** (practicing the presence of God).

Most people don't know this: **the Puritans were meditators**. Calvin emphasized contemplation. The Reformed tradition has a rich, often forgotten contemplative stream. This isn't Buddhist mindfulness repackaged—it's recovering practices from **our own theological heritage**.

In an age of anxiety, control, and spiritual striving, Reformed mindfulness offers radical freedom: **God's sovereignty means you can let go**. Present-moment awareness becomes theological obedience. Observing your thoughts without judgment reflects the doctrine of total depravity rightly understood.

## Why Reformed Theology & Mindfulness Belong Together

**Sovereignty creates surrender** — God's absolute control means you can let go of yours. Mindfulness becomes practicing what you already believe.

**Total depravity enables honest self-observation** — When you know you're broken, you can observe thoughts without identifying with them or defending yourself.

**Unconditional election grounds you in being chosen** — No need to earn God's favor through perfect meditation. You practice from rest, not for acceptance.

**Irresistible grace means God's work, not yours** — Spiritual transformation happens through grace, not effort. Mindfulness becomes receptivity.

**Perseverance guarantees completion** — You'll finish this journey. Patience with the process reflects trust in God's promise to complete His work.

Together, these doctrines form the **most freeing foundation for contemplative practice** ever conceived.

## The Forgotten Puritan Contemplatives

### Richard Baxter (1615-1691)
Author of *The Saints' Everlasting Rest*, Baxter taught methodical meditation practices that included visualization, affective prayer, and contemplative Scripture reading.

### Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758)
Famous for his mystical experiences described in *Personal Narrative*—Edwards practiced sustained contemplation of God's beauty and glory in creation.

### John Owen (1616-1683)
His works on "mortification" (observing and releasing sin patterns) and communion with God are essentially mindfulness techniques grounded in Reformed theology.

### Occasional Meditation
Puritans practiced finding God in everyday moments—seeing a sunrise, tasting bread, hearing birds—and turning observations into theological reflection. Sound familiar?

---

## Reformed Mindfulness Practices You'll Learn

### 1. Sovereignty Breathing
- **Inhale:** "The Lord gives"
- **Exhale:** "The Lord takes away"
- **Hold:** "Blessed be His name" (Job 1:21)

### 2. Heidelberg Meditation
Sit with Question 1 of the Heidelberg Catechism:
*"What is your only comfort in life and death?"*

Feel the answer in your body: "That I am not my own, but belong—body and soul, in life and in death—to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ."

### 3. Coram Deo Walking Meditation
Walk consciously "before the face of God"—aware that every step, every breath, every thought occurs in His presence.

### 4. Puritan Occasional Meditation
- Choose any object or event
- Observe it mindfully without judgment
- Ask: "What does this teach me about God?"
- Journal your reflections

### 5. Five Solas Body Scan
Move through your body, releasing each part to each Sola:
- **Sola Scriptura** — Where am I trusting my own wisdom instead of God's Word?
- **Sola Fide** — Where am I relying on works instead of faith?
- **Sola Gratia** — Where am I striving instead of receiving?
- **Solus Christus** — Where am I seeking other mediators?
- **Soli Deo Gloria** — Where am I seeking my own glory?

### 6. Reformed Daily Examen
- **Morning:** "Where will I encounter God's sovereignty today?"
- **Evening:** "Where did I see His providence at work today?"

## Addressing Common Reformed Concerns

### "Isn't mindfulness Buddhist?"
Mindfulness is a **practice**, not a worldview. Just as we use logic (Greek), technology (secular), and medicine (universal), we can use contemplative practices without adopting Buddhist metaphysics.

**Historical precedent:** Puritans practiced meditation for 300 years before Buddhism reached the West. We're recovering **our own tradition**, not borrowing someone else's.

### "Doesn't this lead to works righteousness?"
**Absolutely not.** Reformed mindfulness flows from **grace received**, not grace earned. You practice **because** you're justified, not **to become** justified.

Sanctification involves spiritual disciplines—Calvin, the Puritans, and every Reformed confession affirm this. The question isn't *whether* to practice, but *how*—and Reformed theology provides the freest framework imaginable.

### "What about the danger of quietism?"
True Reformed contemplation **serves action**, not replaces it. Kuyper's "every square inch" claim still stands—we just bring mindful presence to **all of life**, not withdrawal from it.

Calvin himself balanced deep contemplation with world-transforming action. Mindfulness makes us **more** effective in our callings, not less.

### "Isn't this just repackaged Catholic mysticism?"
**No.** While we honor Catholic contemplatives, Reformed meditation has distinct features:
- Grounded in **Sola Scriptura** (Scripture-centered, not experience-centered)
- Focused on **God's sovereignty** (not achieving union through technique)
- Practiced **in the world** (not monastic withdrawal)
- Rooted in **covenant faithfulness** (not individual enlightenment)

We're recovering **Reformed contemplation**, which has always existed alongside (and distinct from) Catholic mysticism.

## TULIP as Meditation Framework

### Total Depravity → Observing Without Identifying
When you know you're broken, you can watch your thoughts without being enslaved by them. "That's my pride talking" becomes easier when you expect depravity.

**Practice:** Sit for 10 minutes. Notice thoughts without judgment. Remind yourself: "I am not my thoughts—I am God's redeemed child observing the remnants of the old self."

### Unconditional Election → Resting in Being Chosen
You don't meditate to become chosen—you **already are**. This practice is response, not requirement. Pure freedom.

**Practice:** Breathe into the reality: "Before the foundation of the world, God chose me." Let achievement-striving melt away.

### Limited Atonement → Meditating on Particular Love
Christ died specifically, intentionally, personally **for you**. Not generic love—targeted, particular, intimate redemption.

**Practice:** Place your hand on your heart. Repeat: "Christ died for me. Not just humanity—me. By name."

### Irresistible Grace → Noticing God's Work Within
You don't produce transformation through perfect technique. Grace works irresistibly. Your job is to **notice and cooperate**, not generate and control.

**Practice:** Sit quietly. Ask: "Where is grace already at work in me?" Listen. Notice. Receive.

### Perseverance of the Saints → Patient Trust
God will complete what He started (Philippians 1:6). This journey has a guaranteed destination. Patience with the process reflects trust in the promise.

**Practice:** When frustrated with slow progress, return to this truth: "He who began a good work in me will carry it to completion."

## Creating Your Reformed Rule of Life

From the Latin *regula* (trellis)—a structure supporting spiritual growth. Not legalism, but **covenant faithfulness** expressed in sustainable rhythms.

Your Reformed Rule of Life might include:

**Daily:**
- 15-20 minutes Sovereignty Breathing or Heidelberg Meditation
- Coram Deo awareness throughout the day
- Evening Examen

**Weekly:**
- Sabbath rest (actual ceasing from work!)
- Extended Scripture meditation session
- Puritan occasional meditation practice

**Monthly:**
- Half-day personal retreat
- Spiritual direction or accountability meeting

**Yearly:**
- 2-3 day silent retreat
- Read a Puritan meditation classic

The goal is **sustainability**, not perfection. Grace-based structure, not law-based striving.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to be Reformed to attend?**
The practices are designed for Reformed believers (Presbyterian, Reformed, Christian Reformed, PCA, OPC, etc.), but anyone curious about Reformed theology and contemplative practice is welcome.

**What if I've never meditated before?**
Perfect! We start from the beginning, grounding everything in Reformed theology first, then building practices slowly.

**Will this make me less Reformed?**
Actually, it might make you **more** Reformed—experientially grounding doctrines you've only known intellectually. Many participants report deeper understanding of sovereignty, grace, and covenant after embodying these truths through practice.

**How much time will I need for daily practice?**
Start with 10-15 minutes. The Puritans recommended an hour daily, but we live in different times. Sustainability matters more than duration.

**Is this compatible with my church's teaching?**
Everything taught is grounded in Reformed confessions (Westminster, Heidelberg, Belgic), historical Puritan practice, and Calvin's own writings. If your church affirms these, this workshop aligns perfectly.

**Do you offer spiritual direction?**
Yes—we can connect you with Reformed spiritual directors trained in this approach. Week 4 introduces discernment practices to help you determine if direction is your next step.

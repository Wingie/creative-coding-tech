Traditional synthesis is math. `SinOsc.ar(440)`.
Neural synthesis is magic. `BlackBox.predict(Techno)`.

We are connecting **SuperCollider** (the grandfather of audio code) with **PyTorch** (the brain of the new god).
Why? Because I got tired of turning knobs.
I wanted a synthesizer that *listens*.

## Timbre Transfer

Imagine taking the sound of a Cello and forcing it through the math of a Chainsaw.
That is **Timbre Transfer**.
We use a Neural Network to map the spectral features of one sound onto another.
It sounds like a nightmare. It sounds beautiful.

Most coding bootcamps teach you how to center a `<div>` so you can sell more shoes to people who don't need them.

I am tired of it. You are tired of it.

If I see one more "ToDo List App" tutorial, I will scream.

**The Conscious Coder Workshop** is different.
We use the **micro:bit**. It's a tiny, $20 computer.
We build a **Smart Greenhouse**.
We don't care about "Scale." We care about **Soil Moisture**.

## Who is this for?
- **The Burned-Out Marketer**: You realized your "Optimization Strategy" is just making people buy junk.
- **The Teacher**: You want to show kids that computers are for more than TikTok.
- **The Parent**: You want your kid to know that food comes from the ground, not Uber Eats.

We teach **Planetary Service**.
It sounds hippie-dippie. It's not. It's about engineering constraints.
Nature has hard constraints. Your AWS credit card does not.
Learning to code with constraints makes you a better engineer.

# Transformative Workshops at the Intersection of Technology & Mindfulness

What if learning to code could also be a contemplative practice? What if meditation could enhance your creative performances? What if the way you relate to technology could shift from consumption to conscious creation?

These workshops explore the messy, beautiful spaces where **technical mastery meets mindful awareness**, where **creative exploration** meets **inner development**, and where **practical skills** serve **deeper questions about how we want to live**.

## Our Offerings

### üßò Basic Meditation: Foundation Practices for Mindful Living

**6 weeks √ó 90 minutes** | Beginner-friendly | No experience needed

In a world that never stops demanding your attention, learn to return to the present moment. This isn't meditation-as-stress-relief (though that happens). This is meditation as training in awareness itself‚Äîthe capacity to be fully present with whatever arises.

Learn three core practices: concentration (Samadhi), insight (Vipassana), and lovingkindness (Metta). Discover how to work with difficult emotions using the RAIN technique. Most importantly, establish your own sustainable daily practice that actually sticks.

By the end, you'll have tools for bringing mindfulness into eating, walking, working, listening‚Äîtransforming ordinary moments into opportunities for presence.

### üéµ Ableton Live + Sonic Pi: Hybrid Live Performance

**8 sessions √ó 4 hours** | For musicians & creative coders | Some music or code experience helpful

Live coding meets digital production. Algorithm meets intuition. Code meets clips.

Learn to wield both **Sonic Pi's** expressive live coding and **Ableton Live's** production power in a unified performance workflow. Start with fundamentals (MIDI, OSC, Ableton Link), then build toward hybrid setups where improvisation happens at multiple levels simultaneously.

Use Sonic Pi to sequence Ableton instruments. Process live-coded audio through Ableton's effects. Develop your own performance rig that balances algorithmic generation with hands-on control. By the final session, perform a live set demonstrating your unique approach.

Perfect for electronic musicians wanting to add live coding, producers curious about algorithms, or anyone drawn to the edge where composition becomes performance becomes code.

### üåÄ Algorithms as Code: Generative Art & Creative Coding

**8 sessions √ó 4 hours** | No coding experience required | Perfect for visual artists

What if algorithms weren't just for optimization, but for aesthetic exploration? This workshop teaches you to wield loops, recursion, randomness, and mathematical functions as brushes for painting with code.

Using **p5.js** (beginner-friendly JavaScript), generate visual compositions through algorithmic processes. Discover how code structures produce visual outcomes. Explore noise functions, particle systems, fractals, cellular automata, physics simulations. Study pioneering algorithmic artists from Vera Moln√°r to Casey Reas.

Develop your personal algorithmic aesthetic. Create interactive and animated systems. Export work for print, web, and installation. This is art-making through computation‚Äîwhere mathematics becomes visual poetry.

No prior programming experience needed. Just curiosity about the intersection of code and creativity.

### üñåÔ∏è Conscious Art Making: Mindfulness-Based Creative Practice

**6 sessions √ó 4 hours** | All levels | No art experience necessary

Reclaim art-making as a contemplative practice. Not "being good at art." Not producing portfolio pieces. Just **presence, process, and play**.

Drawing on mindfulness meditation, authentic movement, and expressive arts therapy, create a safe space for exploring creativity without judgment. Each session: meditation to arrive, then intuitive art-making using diverse materials (drawing, painting, collage, clay, movement, sound).

No techniques to master. No right way. Just following curiosity, befriending uncertainty, trusting the body's wisdom. Explore how emotions want to move and take form. Discover what the hand knows that the thinking mind doesn't. Let materials become collaborators.

This is art as inquiry, healing, and return to the unselfconscious creativity we knew as children‚Äînow held in adult awareness. Process over product. Presence over perfection.

### üåç Conscious Consumerism: Inner Alignment & Planetary Healing

**8 sessions √ó 90 minutes** | Complete series recommended | Life-changing

"You are what you buy," whispers the culture. But what if your consumption patterns could shift from unconscious habit driven by hidden needs toward conscious choice aligned with your deepest values?

This transformative workshop uses **integral theory, developmental psychology, shadow work, and embodied meditation** to guide that shift. Examine how the "ongoing Big Bang" of each present moment makes every purchase a creative act. Apply the AQAL model to map consumption holistically. Understand how your developmental stage shapes what you value and buy.

But understanding alone doesn't create change. Through **authentic movement**, embody your consumption patterns‚Äîfeel the dopamine loop, move through a product's full lifecycle from extraction to landfill. Shadow work reveals disowned needs driving compulsive buying. Cultivate "inner aliveness" so fulfillment can be sourced internally rather than through acquisition.

Learn practical strategies (reduce, reuse, repair, circular economy) rooted in inner work that makes sustainable action feel like **freedom rather than deprivation**. Join the tipping point‚Äîthe 10% of humanity embodying integral consciousness needed to shift collective culture.

Not about perfectionism or guilt. About alignment, wholeness, and recognizing that how you consume reflects who you're becoming.

### üíª The Conscious Coder: Engineering for Sustainability

**8 sessions √ó 4 hours** | No coding experience required | Hands-on with hardware

Most coding education treats technology as purely instrumental. This workshop asks: What if coding was a contemplative practice? What if programming could deepen your relationship with the living world?

Using the **micro:bit Smart Agriculture Kit** (sensors for temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light), learn to code while keeping your hands in the dirt. Build environmental dashboards. Create intelligent automation systems. Optimize resource use‚Äîirrigation triggered by actual moisture, lighting adjusted to natural cycles.

But you're not just coding tools. You're engaging ethical questions: What does "optimal" mean? How do values embed in code? When we automate care, what do we gain and lose? How can technology support zero-waste living?

Advanced sessions explore machine learning for pattern recognition, building local sensor networks, designing for transparency and repairability. Complete a personal project applying skills to real sustainability challenges in your life.

Learn to become the kind of technologist who asks **"Should we build this?"** before **"Can we?"**‚Äîand who codes in service of life.

### üìÖ Conscious Planning: Integral Approaches to Time & Life Design

**8 sessions √ó 4 hours** | For the overwhelmed & the seeking | Series recommended

Productivity culture promises the right system will finally make you feel in control. But beneath procrastination and endless to-do lists lie deeper questions: **What truly matters? Whose priorities am I serving? What am I avoiding by staying busy?**

Apply integral frameworks to how you relate to time, projects, and what you're doing with your life. Start with meditation revealing how you experience time (scarcity? enemy? taskmaster?) and what becomes possible in the eternal now. Use AQAL to recognize that planning requires attending to not just tasks and systems, but intentions, energy, and cultural narratives you've internalized.

The shadow work here is potent: What are you proving by staying busy? What feelings does an empty calendar evoke? If you completed everything, what would you face?

Learn practical skills: AQAL-informed project planning, energetic time management working with natural rhythms, regular reviews preventing drift from becoming crisis. But tools only work rooted in inner work.

Move from frantic doing toward mindful being. From compulsive productivity toward purposeful contribution. From **life as project management toward life as embodied presence**.

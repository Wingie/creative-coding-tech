You know the guy. The one who sneers if you don't use Vim.
The one who asks "Oh, you use Windows?" with a look of pity.
**That guy is killing your community.**

If you want a community of 5 people who all smell like old Mountain Dew, keep gatekeeping.
If you want a movement, you need to open the door.

## The "Merit" Myth
"But we want quality!" you cry.
Bullshit. You want people who look and think like you.
Diversity isn't "nice." It's **evolutionary survival**. Monocultures die. Polyculters thrive.
If your meetup is just white dudes in hoodies talking about Haskell type systems, you are already dead.

Electronic music performance is boring.
I said it.
A glow-in-the-dark mouse and a pre-recorded WAV file is not a "Performance." It's playback.

**Live Coding** is different. Live Coding is high-stakes jazz with a syntax error.
If you mess up a variable, the music stops. The audience stares. You sweat.
**This is what makes it alive.**

## The Hybrid Approach

We combine **Ableton Live** (Reliability) with **Sonic Pi** (Chaos).
Ableton handles the heavy lifting (drums, vocals).
Sonic Pi handles the risk (improvisational algorithms).

## Who Needs This?
- **Producers**: Who are bored of their own tracks.
- **Programmers**: Who want to be rock stars (at least for an hour).
- **Teachers**: Who want to trick kids into learning loops by making beats.

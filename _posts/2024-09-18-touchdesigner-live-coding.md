Text is great. I love text.
But sometimes you want to connect a `Noise SOP` to a `Geometry COMP` and watch it wiggle.
**TouchDesigner** is visual programming that doesn't suck.
It is standard C++ OpenGL hidden behind a beautiful UI of wires.
It allows you to do in 5 minutes what takes 5 days in raw WebGL.
And it crashes just as often.

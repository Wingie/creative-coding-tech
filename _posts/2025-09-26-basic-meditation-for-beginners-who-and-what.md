Your brain is running a legacy operating system (Caveman OS 1.0).
It was optimized for:
1.  Avoiding Tigers.
2.  Finding Berries.
3.  Procreating.

It was **not** optimized for:
1.  Slack Notifications.
2.  Existential Dread about Climate Change.
3.  Being calm.

## Debugging the Kernel

Meditation is not "Clearing your mind." You cannot clear your mind.
Meditation is **attaching a debugger** to your own consciousness.
You look at the stack trace of your anger.
You look at the memory leak of your anxiety.
And you realize: "Oh, that's just a process running in the background. I don't have to listen to it."

## Who Needs This?
- **Skeptics**: Who think meditation is for monks.
- **Overthinkers**: Whose brains won't shut up at 3am.
- **Parents**: Who are one spilled juice box away from a meltdown.

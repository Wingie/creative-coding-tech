You put a Kinect in a gallery.
People wave their arms. The screen does *something*.
They get bored in 30 seconds.
**This is the failure mode of Interactive Art.**

A "Technology Demon" is not an "Installation."
An installation is a conversation.
If your conversation is "I wave hand -> Screen goes blurp," it is a boring conversation.

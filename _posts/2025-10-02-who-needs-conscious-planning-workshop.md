You have tried GTD. You have tried Bullet Journaling. You have tried Notion (God help you).
You are still overwhelmed.

Why? because you are trying to optimize a biological system (you) using tools designed for mechanical systems (factories).

**Efficiency is for robots. Aliveness is for humans.**

## The Optimization Trap

"If I just get up at 5am..."
"If I just time-block my Saturday..."

No. You will just be tired and angry at 5am.
The problem isn't your *schedule*. The problem is your *values*. You are prioritizing "doing things" over "being alive."

## This Workshop is an Intervention

We use **Integral Theory (AQAL)**. It sounds academic. It is. But it works.
We look at:
1.  **The Interior**: Why are you scared of silence?
2.  **The Exterior**: Yes, your calendar is a disaster.
3.  **The Cultural**: Why does society tell you "Rest is Lazy"?

If you are a high-achiever who is secretly miserable, or a parent who feels like a failing logistics manager... this is for you.

We spent 50 years trying to kill GOTO.
We invented Structured Programming. We invented Classes. We invented Monads.
And then AI came along and said:
"You know what would be cool? If we connected everything with spaghetti wires."

**ComfyUI** is a mess. It is a visual disaster.
And it is the only way to do generative AI without losing your mind.
Because AI pipelines are not linear. They are graphs.
And graphs look like spaghetti.

We teach programming wrong.
We start with `int i = 0;`.
Boring.
We should start with **Noise**.

## The Pi Jam Experiment
I put 8-year-olds and 80-year-olds in a room with Sonic Pi.
The 8-year-olds didn't ask "Is this Object Oriented?"
They asked "How do I make it sound like a fart?"
And then they learned loops, variables, and functions to achieve that noble goal.
**Play is the only way to learn.**

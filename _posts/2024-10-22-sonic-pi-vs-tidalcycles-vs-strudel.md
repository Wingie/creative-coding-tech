Programmers love Holy Wars.
Vim vs Emacs. Tabs vs Spaces.
Now we have: **Ruby vs Haskell vs JavaScript**.

- **Sonic Pi (Ruby)**: For teachers and people who like to sleep at night.
- **TidalCycles (Haskell)**: For math PhDs who hate themselves.
- **Strudel (JavaScript)**: For people who accidentally opened the Chrome Developer Console.

There is no winner. Only different flavors of suffering (and joy).

You are in your bedroom. The code works.
You are on stage. The code breaks.
Why? Because the Gods of Hacking hate you.

**Performance is not Engineering.**
Performance is Psychology.
It is the art of pretending you meant to do that.
When you type `slep 1` instead of `sleep 1`, and the beat stops, you have two choices:
1.  Panic.
2.  Raise your hands like a wizard and pretend the silence is "Avant Garde."

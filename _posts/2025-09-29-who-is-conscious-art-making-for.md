Technique is a prison.

You think you can't draw because you can't make a photorealistic apple.
**Who cares about apples?** You have an iPhone for that.

Art isn't about replication. It's about **Metabolism**.
You absorb the world (which is chaotic and scary), and you output... something. The art is the byproduct of that digestion.

## If You Are a "Perfectionist"

Perfectionism is just Cowardice in a fancy hat.
You are afraid to look stupid.
In this workshop, looking stupid is the **Goal**.

If you make a beautiful painting, I will ask you to paint over it.
Why? Because attachment is suffering. And because your beautiful painting is boring.
The ugly smudge you made when you were crying? That's art.

## Who Needs This?
- **Designers**: Who are slaves to the Grid.
- **Engineers**: Who think creativity is a "Soft Skill."
- **Therapists**: Who need to scream into a pillow (or a canvas).

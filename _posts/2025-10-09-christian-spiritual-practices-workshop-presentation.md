# Christian Spiritual Practices: Ecumenical Foundations for Deeper Faith

Discover how **ancient Christian spiritual practices** can transform your relationship with God. Our ecumenical workshop teaches **Lectio Divina** (sacred reading), **Centering Prayer** (resting in God's presence), **Daily Office** (liturgy of the hours), and **contemplative listening**—drawing from Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and Charismatic traditions.

In an age of shallow spirituality and noisy faith, these **time-tested practices** have sustained Christians for 2,000 years. This isn't about gathering more information about God—it's about cultivating genuine **intimacy with God through contemplative prayer and spiritual disciplines**.

Sanctify your day through morning, midday, evening, and night prayer—joining millions across Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican traditions who pray these hours daily.

### ✝️ **Practices Across All Christian Traditions**
Honor the richness of the entire Christian family: Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Protestant, Charismatic, and ecumenical streams like Taizé.

Understand the role of spiritual directors and guides—companions who help you notice and respond to God's movement in your life.

## Why These Four Practices Work Together

**Lectio Divina gives you roots in Scripture** — God's Word becomes living and active, not just studied. You're anchored in revelation.

**Centering Prayer gives you intimacy** — Moving beyond words to rest in God's loving presence. You're cultivating union.

**Daily Office gives you rhythm** — Sanctifying time itself through morning, noon, and evening consecrated to God. You're living liturgically.

**Contemplation gives you discernment** — Learning to distinguish God's voice from your own thoughts and cultural noise. You're maturing spiritually.

Together, they form a **balanced spiritual life: rooted, intimate, rhythmic, and discerning**.

## What is a Rule of Life?

From the Latin "regula" (trellis)—a structure that supports spiritual growth. Not rigid law, but loving framework for flourishing.

Your personal Rule of Life might include:
- **Daily:** 20 minutes Centering Prayer or Lectio Divina
- **Daily:** Morning and Evening Prayer from the Daily Office
- **Weekly:** Sabbath rest and extended prayer time
- **Monthly:** Spiritual direction session or half-day retreat
- **Yearly:** 3-5 day silent retreat

The goal is **sustainability, not perfection**. Start small, adjust seasonally, and design a rhythm that fits your life stage and calling.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to be from a specific Christian tradition?**
No! This workshop honors practices from Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Charismatic, and ecumenical traditions. All Christians seeking deeper intimacy with God are welcome.

**What if I've never done contemplative prayer?**
Perfect—we start from the beginning with silence, posture, and basic practices. Week 1 is entirely devoted to introduction.

**Is this "too Catholic" for Protestants or "too Protestant" for Catholics?**
These practices belong to the whole Church. Catholics will see familiar devotions honored. Protestants will discover the contemplative stream that informed Luther, Calvin, and Wesley. Orthodox will recognize hesychast and liturgical roots.

**How much time will I need for home practice?**
We recommend starting with 15-20 minutes daily. The practices are designed to be sustainable for busy lives.

**What's the difference between Centering Prayer and meditation?**
Centering Prayer is explicitly Christian—a prayer of consent to God's presence and action within you. It's not emptying the mind, but resting in the One who fills all things.

**Do you offer spiritual direction?**
Yes, we can connect you with trained spiritual directors from various traditions. Week 5 introduces the practice and helps you discern if direction is your next step.

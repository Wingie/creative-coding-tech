A vision quest is not a retreat. It is a threshold—a deliberate encounter with solitude, hunger, and the raw presence of nature designed to strip away everything that is not essential.

## What This Is

Four days and nights alone in wilderness. No food. No shelter beyond what you carry. No distractions. Only you, the land, and whatever arises.

I guide small groups (4-8 people) through the full arc:

### Preparation (2 days)

- Clarifying your intention
- Learning to read signs and synchronicities
- Understanding the ceremonial container
- Practical wilderness skills

### Threshold (4 days/nights)

- Solo time in a marked sacred space
- Daily check-ins for safety
- Fasting with water

### Integration (2 days)

- Returning from the mountain
- Storytelling and witnessing
- Grounding the vision in daily life

## Where

Locations rotate seasonally across Europe:

- **Ardennes (Belgium)** - Spring
- **Scottish Highlands** - Summer
- **Pyrenees (Spain)** - Autumn

## Who This Is For

You're at a threshold. Career change. Relationship ending. Midlife questioning. Creative block. Something needs to die so something new can be born.

You don't need wilderness experience. You need the willingness to be uncomfortable.

## Investment

**Full 8-day program:** €1,800 - €2,400

- Varies by location and group size
- Includes all meals during preparation and integration

**1:1 Vision Quest Intensive:** €4,500

## About the Guide

I've trained in wilderness rites of passage and hold deep respect for this ancient practice. My background bridges technology and contemplative practice—8 years as an engineering leader, alongside ongoing study of insight meditation, shadow work, and esoteric consultation.

This combination matters. Many seekers carry questions about meaning and purpose shaped by careers in tech, finance, or other high-pressure fields. I speak both languages.

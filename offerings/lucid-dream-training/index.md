In a lucid dream, you know you're dreaming while you're dreaming. This awareness transforms sleep from passive recovery into active exploration—a laboratory for facing fears, rehearsing challenges, and encountering aspects of psyche normally hidden from view.

## The Technical Edge

My approach differs from most lucid dreaming courses in one key way: I treat dreams as information systems.

As an engineer, I'm interested in the *architecture* of dreaming—the consistent patterns, the signal-to-noise ratio, the debugging process when techniques don't work. This analytical lens, combined with contemplative practice, creates a framework that works for people who need to understand *why* something works, not just that it does.

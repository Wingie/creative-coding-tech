The shadow contains everything you've rejected, hidden, or simply never had permission to be. Your anger, your power, your sexuality, your creativity, your darkness—but also your light, your gifts, your unlived potential.

Shadow work is the process of reclaiming these parts. Not fixing them. Reclaiming them.

## How We Work

**Individual Sessions** combine:

- Dialogue with shadow figures
- Somatic awareness and body-based techniques
- Active imagination and visualization
- Integration practices for daily life

### The Arc of a Session

1. Identify what's constellated (the pattern showing up in your life)
2. Locate it in the body
3. Give it voice/form/image
4. Dialogue and negotiation
5. Integration ritual
6. Homework for embodiment

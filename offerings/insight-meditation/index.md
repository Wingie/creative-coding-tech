Insight meditation (vipassana) is the practice of seeing clearly—observing the arising and passing of all phenomena without grasping or aversion. It's simple, but not easy. And it transforms everything.

## What I Offer

**Weekly Sits (Amsterdam)**

- Thursday evenings, 7-9pm
- Guided meditation + dharma talk
- All levels welcome
- Dana (donation) based

**Individual Instruction**

- Personalized practice guidance
- Working with specific hindrances
- Deepening concentration
- Navigating difficult territory

**Retreat Support**

- Preparation for intensive retreats
- Integration after retreats
- Practice between retreats

## The Practice

Insight meditation strips away technique to reveal what's always already here:

- **Attention to breathing** as anchor
- **Noting** to sharpen awareness
- **Body scanning** to include the whole field
- **Choiceless awareness** as practice matures

The goal is not to feel good (though you might). The goal is to see clearly how experience actually works—its impermanence, its unsatisfactoriness when grasped, its lack of fixed self.

## Background

I've practiced insight meditation for 15+ years, including multiple extended retreats in the Mahasi Sayadaw tradition. I'm not a monk or authorized teacher in any formal lineage—I'm a householder practitioner who has found this practice indispensable and wants to share it.

## Rates

**Weekly Sits:** Dana (suggested €10-20)

**Individual Session:** €100 (60 minutes)

**Monthly Mentorship:** €300 (4 sessions)

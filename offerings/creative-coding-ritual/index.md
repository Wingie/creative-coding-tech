Most creative coding education focuses on output—make cool visuals, build interactive installations, learn the tools. This is valuable, but incomplete.

What if code itself could be a contemplative practice? What if the act of programming could be as meditative as sitting?

## The Approach

We treat creative coding as a vehicle for:

- **Attention training** — The focus required to debug is the same focus cultivated in meditation
- **Surrender** — Generative systems teach us to release control and collaborate with emergence
- **Ritual creation** — Building personal tools for transformation, not just entertainment
- **Embodied technology** — Gesture control, biofeedback, body-as-interface

## What We Work With

- **TouchDesigner** — Real-time visual systems
- **Sonic Pi / SuperCollider** — Live coded music
- **Wekinator + gesture control** — Body-responsive systems
- **Custom ritual tools** — Whatever serves your practice

## Why This Matters

Technology shapes consciousness. The tools we use, the systems we build, the interfaces we inhabit—all of these condition how we perceive and interact with reality.

Most technology is designed for extraction—attention, data, money. But it doesn't have to be. We can build technologies that support awareness, that facilitate connection, that serve transformation.

This is what I mean by creative coding as ritual: building tools that change us for the better.

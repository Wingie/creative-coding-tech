The Oracle is where we begin.

Before sessions, before offerings, before anything formal—a conversation to understand what brings you here and what might serve.

## How It Works

1. **You share what's present** - The situation, the question, the threshold you're facing. A few sentences or a few paragraphs.

2. **I respond** - Within 48 hours, I'll share initial thoughts on what might be helpful. Sometimes that's one of my offerings. Sometimes it's a resource, a practice, or a referral to someone better suited.

3. **We decide together** - If there's a fit, we discuss next steps. If not, you've lost nothing but a few minutes.

No commitment. No sales pitch. Just clarity.

## What This Isn't

The Oracle isn't:
- An AI chatbot
- A cold email funnel
- A barrier to accessing my work

It's a human-to-human conversation, initiated with intention on both sides.

## Response Time

I typically respond within 48 hours. If something is urgent, say so.

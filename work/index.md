Selected projects from the intersection of creative technology and contemplative practice.

## Installations

### Breath Mirror

An interactive installation that visualizes the breath of participants in real-time. Built with TouchDesigner, biofeedback sensors, and projection mapping. Exhibited at various consciousness and technology events.

The piece explores how making the invisible visible changes our relationship to it. When you can see your breath as flowing light, something shifts in how you breathe.

### Algorithmic Meditation

A generative audio-visual environment that responds to group meditation. EEG and heart rate variability data from multiple participants shapes an evolving soundscape and visual field. The system doesn't gamify meditation—it creates a shared contemplative space.

## Performances

### Live Coded Rituals

Performances combining live coding (Sonic Pi, TidalCycles) with spoken word and ritual structure. Each performance is unique, written in the moment, responding to the space and audience.

Recent performances include TOPLAP events, algorave gatherings, and private ceremonial contexts.

### Sound Journeys

Extended sonic experiences (2-4 hours) designed to support deep states. A combination of live synthesis, prepared materials, and responsive improvisation. Often paired with breathwork, meditation, or other contemplative practices.

## Workshops Developed

### Conscious Coder

An 8-week program exploring code as contemplative practice. Participants build personal ritual tools while developing their relationship to attention, emergence, and creative surrender.

### Algorithms as Code

Introduction to algorithmic thinking for artists and non-programmers. Focuses on the conceptual foundations rather than syntax, using visual and musical systems.

### The Dreaming Machine

A weekend intensive on working with dreams and technology. Combines lucid dream training, dream journaling practice, and building simple dream-responsive systems.
